# Drag-to-scroll

Firefox addon that allows scrolling by clicking and dragging on the page.

You can switch from this behaviour and normal click/drag behaviour by clicking on any text (mouse-down + mouse-up without any mouse movement in between). You can switch back into the dragging mode by clicking twice on any non-text (mouse-down + mouse-up + mouse-down without any mouse movement in between)

Clicking and dragging on any element while in dragging mode will ignore normal drag behaviour, allowing you to scroll without having to worry if you mouse-down'd on a link, image or text.

Useful for scrolling, but still allowing you to double click text to start selecting text normally.
