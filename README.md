# Drag-to-scroll

Firefox addon that allows scrolling by clicking and dragging on the page.

In order to be able to do normal interaction like selecting text you can change between this addon's behaviour and default Firefox behaviour by clicking without moving the mouse for the entire click. Clicking on text will set to default Firefox behaviour and clicking textless space will set to this addon's behaviour.
